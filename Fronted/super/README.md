# Please introduce yourself.

Hello, sir! 
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is kanhaiya chauhan, and I am from gorakhpur, uttar pradesh.

In terms of my education, I completed my graduation in Bachelor of Arts in 2022 from siddharth university,up. Recently I have done my full stack web development full-time 35-week course from Masai School. This is a military-type coding school. During this course, I have built a couple of projects from scratch including indivisible and collaborative. I have hands-on experience in coding 1200 hours+ and in Dsa 1000+ problem-solved. In my family, my father is a farmer, my mother is a homemaker, i have a 2 younger sister. 
My hobbies are travelling and coding.-,that's all about my self. Thank you!

The sessionStorage object stores data only for a session. It means that the data stored in the sessionStorage will be deleted when the browser is closed.

# middleware in nodejs 
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object ( req ), the response object ( res ), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next .

# session state
Server-side state management utilizes user sessions to maintain information and its flow shared between the website's web pages. The web server stores the client session information and uses cookies to store keys associated with a particular client. Session expiration can clear a user's information.

# mongodb aggregation

Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. Not only do we have the ability to aggregate data on the client side with JavaScript, but we can use MongoDB to run operations on the server against our collections stored in the database before the result is returned to the client.

# hooks in react js;
hooks in React are special functions that let you add state, effects, and other features to functional components. They replace the need for class components, making your code cleaner and more organized by allowing you to manage component behavior using smaller, reusable functions.

# Please prepare on these lines : What is ReactJS and why is it trending?

# What is Event Loop in NodeJS?
An event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them, and then sleeps until it receives more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task. The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.

# The core basics of React and Redux and Node.js
 Redux is an open-source JavaScript library used to manage application state. React uses Redux for building the user interface.

 Node.js is an open-source, server-side, runtime environment that allows you to build and run JavaScript code on the server.


# What is the use of NODE JS, MongoDB, Angular JS?

# JavaScript questions Coding questions like recursion Nodejs, mongodb and reactjs questions

# Difference between == and ===
The equality operator (==) compares values for equality after performing type coercion if necessary. 
The strict equality operator (===) compares both the values and the types of the operands. 

# What is difference between functional component and class based component
A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX).
 A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function that returns a React element.

# How can we execute code in NodeJs in synchronised way?
Using Promises and async/await:
const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readData() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

readData();

# Using setImmediate:

console.log('Start of program');

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('Inside setImmediate');
});

console.log('End of program');


# Q2. Lifecycle methods in React ? Compared to Hooks 
Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.
The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

React Hooks provide a more modern and efficient way to handle component logic compared to the traditional lifecycle methods used in class-based components. They are recommended for new projects and can also be used in conjunction with class-based components when migrating existing code.

 # Q3. What is Redux and it's principles?
 Redux: It is a library for managing states that follow the principles of the flux architecture & is an independent framework, but for the sake of brevity, we'll assume that we are using it with React. Single source of truth. The global state of your application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

# Q4. What is React Router?
React Router is a JavaScript framework that lets us handle client and server-side routing in React applications. It enables the creation of single-page web or mobile apps that allow navigating without refreshing the page.

# How to use aysnc js in ES6
Adding the async keyword in front of a function declaration turns it into an asynchronous function. An async function is a function that knows to expect the possibility of the await keyword being used to invoke asynchronous code.

 # About React like hooks, redux, context api 
 
 # 2. Related to node like middleware, authentication
 Middleware in Node.js refers to functions that are executed in a sequence as a part of the request-response cycle. Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects, and they can perform various tasks like modifying the request, response, or calling the next middleware in the chain. Middleware allows you to add functionality to your application's route handlers without duplicating code.

# What is inner join in SQ

# Promises, Asynchronous function, callback function, event loop, event stack, error handling, generic functions, call bind apply, settimeout, closures, this keyword
Promises: Promises manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript, representing pending, fulfilled, or rejected states.

Asynchronous Function: Handles tasks that might take time, allowing other code to run in the meantime.

Callback Function: A function passed as an argument to another function, executed after a task is complete.

Event Loop: Manages the execution of tasks in JavaScript, checking the call stack and task queue.

Call Stack: Keeps track of functions being executed, adding and removing them in a last-in, first-out order.

Error Handling: Deals with exceptions and unexpected errors during program execution.

Generic Functions: Functions adaptable to different data types due to JavaScript's dynamic typing.

Call, Bind, Apply: Methods to control the value of this and pass arguments to functions.

setTimeout: Schedules a function to run after a specified delay.

Closures: Functions with access to their own, outer, and global scopes; often used for private variables and state.

this Keyword: Refers to the current context; its value depends on how a function is called.

# What is high order function 
 A higher order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result.

# 2. Fetch data using API 3. Difference between var and let 4. What is the arrow function 

# 5. Difference between arrow function and simple function

# Arrow Functions:
Concise syntax: () => {}
Inherits this from the surrounding context.
No arguments object; uses the arguments from the enclosing function.
No super keyword for accessing parent object's methods.
Preferred for short, context-preserving callbacks and concise code.
Doesn't create its own this context.

# Regular (Simple) Functions:
Standard syntax: function () {}
Has its own this context.
Has its own arguments object.
Has super keyword for accessing parent object's methods.
More versatile and suitable for various situations.
Creates its own this context

# What is map() and filter() function?
the map() and filter() functions are higher-order array methods that operate on arrays and allow you to transform and manipulate data in a more concise and functional way.

<!-- #  Why do you want to join our company?

When I got to know that I would have an opportunity to interview with your organization, I wanted to learn more about it. What I found by visiting your website and LinkedIn page is that Kalvium is an Edu-tech. And offers its 4-years on-campus program in collaboration with top accredited Universities in the country.

Being a Masai student, I appreciate the role of Edu-techs in today’s world. Also, the role of Technical mentor is similar to what we have at Masai called Instructional Associates. During my journey at Masai, I received great support from my IAs and I feel grateful to them for their help at every step. Hence, if I am able to take up the responsibilities of a Technical mentor at Kalvium, I would like to contribute to the lives of other students in a similar way. 

# What do you understand are going to be your job responsibilities in the given role? 

As per the job description shared by the placement team at Masai, within the role of a Technical Mentor my top two 2 responsibilities would be:
Ensure the technical growth of a cohort of 40 high-potential students.
As a technical Mentor, it would be key for me to help students in their technical courses as well as projects that will include programming, full stack development, OS, networks, etc.
I would be required to provide guidance and mentorship to students as they are stuck, based on the Kalvium mentorship framework.


# What are your career objectives? Or Where do you see yourself in the next  3-5 years?

“In five years, I see myself as an integral part of the company who has helped contribute to the growth and success of the organization.
I would like to continue developing my skills and knowledge in order to be able to take on more responsibility within the company.
I’m also looking forward to taking on more leadership roles and mentoring other members of the team by utilizing the leadership and mentorship certifications I’ve completed.”

# What are your strengths and weaknesses?

My strength is I am a hardworking person and self-motivated and I can't say no to someone asking for help. I am dedicated to completing tasks on time.

My weakness is I get nervous when speaking in front of large groups. To improve this I have joined the Zoom marathon challenges conducted by Masai. And also I am an overthinking person.


# What is your salary expectation?

Thank you very much for asking me this question :)

The placements team at Masai has given me an idea about the package you are offering, and I am aligned with that. However, I would be happy to know what your final offer is. 
4 LPA
Smile, Thank you very much for your offer. This sounds slightly different from what I understood from the placement team, so, I would just like to re-confirm with them before committing to you. So, would it be okay if I come back to you in a n hour’s time? -->
